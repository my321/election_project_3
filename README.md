# Project 3

### Project Title: <p> Predicting Election Results by County </p>

### Description: <p> Using economics variables from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, can we predict the county election results of the 2016 Presidential election. </p>

### Features and Target Variables: <p> The target feature is which political party (either Republican or Democrat) the county voted for in the 2016 election. Features include total employment in a county, total establishments in the county, year of data, share of employment in each of the 11 sectors, and share of establishments in each of 11 sectors. The 11 sectors include Natural Resources and Mining; Construction; Manufacturing; Trade,transportation, and utilities; Information; Financial activities; Professional and business services; Education and health services; Leisure and hospitality; Other services; and unclassified.    </p>

### Data Used: <p> The BLS economic data was accessed using Google Big Query. The following SQL commands were used: GROUP BY, JOIN, WHERE, and AND. The election data was downloaded from the MIT Election Lab.  </p>

### Tools Used: <p> SQL, Google Biq Query, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Excel, Keynote, git, and gitbhub.  </p>

### Possible impacts of your project: <p> Possible impacts of this project include predicting counties that can be flipped because these counties are borderline Republican and Democratic counties. Many grassroot organizations have limited resources and can't spend money buying voter data to help them target voters. By using widely available data, I can  build a responable model that can help identify counties to target. </p>
